> ## NOTICE
`@redevill/ngx-spinner-svc` this fork is adapted from @Chevtek/angular-spinners, and is intended to resolve the ngModule error, that claims there are functions specified in the ngModule Attribute.

With the rebuild under angular 16 this appears to be again working. A pull request can be organized to upgrade the original library, and will be provided upon request.
